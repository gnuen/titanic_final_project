# Titanic Survival Prediction

Kaggle have a prediction competition, in which the goal is to get as close as possible to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.

In this project I intent to do a basic Logistic Regression model and then do a Random Forest model with a randomized search for hyperparameter tuning.
I am however not planning on submitting my results to Kaggle, since you are supposed to use the train.csv file training and then use the test.csv to predict your result and then submit your result, to be automatically graded online.
